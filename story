once there lived a croc in the river and there lived a monkey on the tree near the river.
once the croc wants to eat fruits on the tree even the monkey wanted to swim in the river.
which wasnt possible for both.


so they thought to become friends and monkey used to give the fruits and the croc used to give ride.
